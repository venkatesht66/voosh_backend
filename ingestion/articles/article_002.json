The 12-month inflation rate for food was 4.9% in October, up from 4.5% in September.\nBread, meat, fish, vegetables, chocolate and confectionary were among the products that rose in price. However fruit prices fell slightly.\nThe fall in inflation means prices are rising more slowly than they were and will foster hope that inflation has peaked, helping to pave the way for lower interest rates.\nInflation remains above the Bank of England's 2% target but the next interest rate decision, due on 18 December, will focus on the longer term impact of raising the cost of borrowing.\n\"Inflation eased in October, driven mainly by gas and electricity prices, which increased less than this time last year, following changes in the Ofgem energy price cap,\" said ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner.\nHousehold energy prices, which are capped by the regulator, rose in the year to October. But the 2% rise in the cap was significantly less than the 9.6% hike last year.\nThe ONS said another factor pulling back inflation was hotel prices. Hotel rates typically fall between the summer and Christmas, but this year they dipped more than last year.\nHowever, fuel prices have risen, affecting drivers and the cost of deliveries.\n\"The annual cost of raw materials for businesses continued to increase, while factory gate prices also rose,\" Mr Fitzner added.\nThe Food and Drink Federation, representing food manufacturers said food price inflation was due to rising costs for ingredients and energy, as well as \"regulatory costs\" including packaging taxes and rising National Insurance.\nRelief\nSarah Coles, head of personal finance at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown said: \"If you're wondering what that warm breeze is, it's the entire country heaving a sigh of relief at the news that inflation has fallen for the first time since March.\"\nLower inflation could also help borrowers, including mortgage holders, if interest rates were to fall, she said.\nThe Bank of England keeps borrowing rates higher if there is concern that prices are rising rise too quickly.\nWith inflation proving \"sticky\" at 3.8% over the last few months the Bank opted at its November meeting to hold interest rates at 4%.\nLower interest rates should help boost growth, another of the chancellor's stated priorities.\nRob Wood chief UK Economist at research firm Pantheon Macroeconomics said he believed a December interest rate cut was now \"nailed-on\" but predicted \"a lengthy delay until another cut\" following that.",
