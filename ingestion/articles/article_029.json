  "maintext": "Available for over a year\nToday, the CEO of Google gives a rare interview to discuss AI, economic risk, climate change and much more. Faisal Islam has been speaking to Sundar Pichai, the head of Google’s parent company Alphabet, about the future of the AI bubble. The tech boss warned that “no company is going to be immune” if the AI bubble bursts after its current period of boom. This comes as some analysts expressed fear that stock markets are heading for a repeat of the dotcom bubble burst of the late 1990s. They also discussed the environmental cost of powering AI, the potential risks to jobs and whether the UK will benefit from the current boom. BBC economics editor Faisal Islam joins Adam in the studio.
